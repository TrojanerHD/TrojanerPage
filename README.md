# Trojaner Page
This repository contains the source code of my web page.

## Contents
Currently, the web page is only a landing page that redirects to my social media but is open to be extended in the future

## Deployment
### Requirements
+ TypeScript

### Compiling
Just run `tsc` in the project root

### Workflow
+ Editing
+ [Compiling](#compiling) (if you have done any changes to the TypeScript)
+ Opening / reloading [index.html](index.html) in your favorite browser
  + Optionally, if you are on Visual Studio Code, you can use the launch configuration (which requires the Debugger for Firefox extension) and run it with Run â†’ Start Debugging. This also compiles the TypeScript but keep in mind that it only compiles once upon start and does not auto-compile on file change.

## Additional notes
+ The design of some parts of this website and parts of the CSS are inspired by [migueravila/Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento)
